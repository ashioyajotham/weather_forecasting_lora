Weather Forecasting with LoRA Fine-tuning
==========================================

A comprehensive implementation of weather forecasting using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
fine-tuning on Large Language Models, following Schulman et al. (2025) methodology.

This project implements:
1. Numerical weather data â†’ Text forecast mapping
2. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with LoRA adapters
3. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with PPO
4. Evaluation and monitoring systems

Architecture:
- Base Model: Mistral-7B or LLaMA-3-8B
- Data Sources: ERA5, Open-Meteo, NOAA
- Training: LoRA adapters with frozen base weights
- Deployment: Modular adapters for different forecasting domains
